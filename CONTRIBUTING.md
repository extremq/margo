This project was created by [Integer 32][i32] and is open source. You
are welcome and encouraged to fork the code to tweak it to your
heart's content.

Some contributions are welcomed while others are _not_. If a
contribution imposes ongoing maintenance burden, it's less likely to
be accepted. If a contribution is only useful to a niche audience,
it's less likely to be accepted.

If you'd like to see a new feature supported, feel free to open [a
discussion][discussion] before starting work, but be aware that "no
thank you, we don't want that" is a possible answer.

If you _really_ want to see a feature supported, reach out to
[us][i32] directly about a paid support contract.
