# Prerequisites

- Rust 1.77 (or newer)
- NodeJS 20 (or newer) with pnpm 9 (or newer)
- Ruby 3.3 (or newer)

You should be able to install these however you want. If you are
looking for suggestions applicable to macOS...

- Rust via [rustup][]
- NodeJS via [Homebrew][]
- pnpm via [Homebrew][]
- Ruby via [RVM][]

[Homebrew]: https://brew.sh
[RVM]: https://rvm.io

# Building

CSS and JS assets are bundled with the release binary in order to
create the crate list HTML page. These assets are not normally checked
into the repository and need to be built by the developer:

```
% cargo xtask assets --watch
```

Once this is running in one window, a normal build via Cargo will suffice:

```
% cargo build
```

# Tests

## Registry conformance

This ensures that the files created by Margo function as a valid Cargo
registry. It drives Margo and Cargo as command line tools, much
like a user would.

These tests are written in Rust and live in the `conformance` directory. To run them:

```
% cd conformance
% cargo run
```

## UI

This ensures that the HTML output generated by Margo is usable and
useful. It drives Margo and Cargo as command line tools, much like a
user would.

These tests are written in Ruby and live in the `integration-tests` directory.

```
% cd integration-tests
% bundle exec rspec
```

# Linting / Formatting
